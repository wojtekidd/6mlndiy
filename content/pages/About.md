Summary: 6 Million Ways to DIY - About the blog and the author

Hi (ノ^∇^)

My name is Wojtek and this is my blog. I'm trying to develop a habit of writing blog posts in English, hence this place.

During the day I work with software developers and product people, taking care of products, communication, clients, and communities. Currently at Mudita. Before that, I was a part of such awesome companies as Sphere Engine, Semaphore CI, CKSource (makers of CKEditor) and the British Council.

When I'm not hanging out with my family I'm trying to [write and record some rap/spoken word pieces](https://wojtekidd.org).

Catch me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wojtekidd) or just [write me an email](mailto:wojtek.cichon@protonmail.com) if you feel like it.
